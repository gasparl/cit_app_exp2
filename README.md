## Experiment 2 mobile application

This application is built using the Ionic Framework: https://ionicframework.com/

To modify it for you own purposes, check out the documentation: https://ionicframework.com/docs

In the simplest case, you can modify the files under **/src/pages/home/**, in particular **home.ts** which contains the JavaScript code for the CIT test. Afterwards, you can build this version as an executable for smartphones (requires Node.js): https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/commands/cordova-build
